# Forest Trails - Random Map Script

Age of Empires II Random Map Script for a "Forest Trails" map.
The map is somewhere between Black Forest and Forest Nothing.

Each player starts with:

  * A main gold and stone in their base with a secondary gold and stone nearby.
  * 6 berry bushes
  * 4 main sheep
  * 2 groups of 2 sheep nearby
  * 5 deer
  * A clearing for their starting base
  * Lots of trees - leaving small paths around the map and between players

To use this map copy it into your Age of Empires II `random-map-script` directory.
With Steam the game directory can be found by right clicking on the game
title, selecting Properties, going to the `LOCAL FILES` tab, then choosing
`BROWSE LOCAL FILES...`.

From there the directory is `resources/_common/random-map-scripts/`.
